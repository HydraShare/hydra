### Description
Create BSDF files for multiphase simulations through this file

Please check [Andy McNeil's tutorial on genBSDF](https://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/Tutorial-genBSDF_v1.0.1.pdf) before using this file!

And his [5-phase tutorial.](https://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/fivephasetutorialfiles/Tutorial-FivePhaseMethod_v2.pdf)
And let's not forget [Sarith's multiphase tutorial.](https://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/matrix-based-methods)

### Radiance parameters
Set -ab and -ad correctly. The -ad 10 in the example is just to do a quick test.
Should be > 1024, perhaps much higher depending on geometry.
